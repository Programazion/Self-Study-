# Self-Study-
The following repository is going to show a simple path to konw my programming successful autonomus process.

One of my wishes is being a full-stack developer, the objective of this project is thought about those who one day wants to be developers or programmers and 
feel frustated. If it is your case, pleaselet me know on the comments.

On the other hand, I look forward my little baby can read me in next years . When she grows up, I'll be more than happy to read it together.

The first step I just decided, it is to create a youtube channel 
Then, I make a commitment to post in Github at the end of the day my progress.

On the other hand, I downloaded Visual studio code, .Net 6.0 and SQLserver 2019.
